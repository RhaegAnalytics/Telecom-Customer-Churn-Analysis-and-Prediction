# Churn Analysis and Prediction for Telecommunication Company

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze customer churn in a telecommunication company and predict potential churners using a Random Forest model. The project leverages Python for data processing and modeling, along with Power BI for data visualization. The primary goal is to identify key factors influencing churn and forecast future churn to help the company devise strategies to retain customers.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python**: machine learning (Random Forest)
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Power Query**: Data cleaning and transformation

## 📂 Project Files

1. **Churn Prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis and Random Forest prediction model.
2. **Predictions.csv**: CSV file containing churn predictions generated by the model.
3. **Churn Dataset.xlsx**: Excel file with raw and cleaned data.
4. **Dashboard Images**: Screenshots of the Power BI dashboard for visual insights.

## 🔄 Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**: Data was cleaned and preprocessed using Power Query to handle missing values and outliers.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed in Python to understand customer demographics and churn distribution.
3. **Model Building**: Implemented a Random Forest model for predicting customer churn.
4. **Prediction Generation**: Saved model predictions to a CSV file.
5. **Data Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards in Power BI to showcase churn patterns and prediction results.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

- **Churn Analysis-Prediction Dashboard**:
  - Visual representation of predicted churn profiles.
  - Breakdown of churn by demographic and contract characteristics.
  - Insights into churn by state, tenure group, and payment method.
- **Churn Analysis-Summary Dashboard**:
  - Overall churn rate and churn distribution by key attributes.
  - Top 5 states with the highest churn rates.
  - Breakdown of churn by internet type and services used.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- High churn rates were observed among month-to-month contracts and customers with short tenure.
- Females had a slightly higher churn rate compared to males.
- Credit card payment method showed the lowest churn rate, while mailed checks showed the highest.
- Online security and premium support services reduced churn significantly.

## 🧠 Model Performance

- The Random Forest model was chosen for its accuracy and robustness in handling large datasets and complex interactions.
- Key metrics evaluated include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Churn Prediction.ipynb`.
2. Run the notebook to train the model and generate predictions.
3. View the prediction results in the `Predictions.csv` file.
4. Explore insights through the Power BI dashboard.

## 📝 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data-driven techniques can effectively identify potential churners and help telecommunication companies strategize customer retention. Future improvements may include implementing hyperparameter tuning and incorporating additional variables to enhance model performance.
